# NeetGame
just a game about a neet. Making this mainly to get an idea of how game engines work. Will obviously move onto using other game engines before i make a final game.


Will not be working on this anymore. Will reuse some of the code here and convert them to c# into unity later on during my free time.

WASD to move, press P to poop, press u to undo, press F11 to save the poop
